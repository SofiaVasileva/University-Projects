Simple Deck Of Cards

Make a program which print in the Console all cards from one deck with their symbols (hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs).
Without Jokers in the deck you have total of 52 cards or 13 cards with 4 different symbols.
Your program must ask “Do you want to see a full deck of cards?” until the user write “yes” in the Console.
Make internet research about how to print icon symbols in the Console.
