The Three Little Pigs is a Silly Symphony released on May 27th 1933, based on the classic fairy tale about a trio of pigs who build their houses out of straw, sticks, and bricks to protect themselves from the Big Bad Wolf. 
The short won the 1934 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. 
In 1994, it was voted #11 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. 
In 2007, Three Little Pigs was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

Since then, the pigs are saving money for Thanks-giving day turkey. 
But the pigs are not so generous. They agreed upon the idea that every day they will pick a real random number & according to the range in which the square root of this number “falls” – there will be a bonus system.
